# Architectural Dependency Analyzer and Visualizer

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive toolset for analyzing and visualizing architectural dependencies within software projects, particularly those structured around **Clean Architecture** or **layered design principles**. It processes DOT-formatted dependency graphs, performs various analyses, and generates enhanced, visually intuitive DOT diagrams.

The tool is specifically designed to work with DOT files generated by Rust's `cargo modules` tool, but its core functionality can be adapted to any DOT-formatted graph representing module dependencies.

## Key Features

* **CLI-driven Analysis**: Easily specify an input DOT file via the command line.
* **Dependency Graph Parsing**: Converts raw DOT file content into a structured `Graph` object for programmatic analysis.
* **Circular Dependency Detection**: Identifies and reports cyclic dependencies within the module graph, helping to pinpoint potential architectural issues.
* **Layer Violation Detection**: Verifies adherence to predefined architectural layer rules (e.g., `domain` should not depend on `application` or `infrastructure`, `application` can only depend on `domain`, `infrastructure` can only depend on `application`). It outputs a clear list of any detected violations.
* **Layered DOT Diagram Generation**: Transforms the input graph into a new DOT file that visually groups modules by their architectural layers (`domain`, `application`, `infrastructure`) using DOT's `subgraph cluster` syntax.
* **Enhanced Visualization**:
  * **Color-coded Layers**: Layers are visually distinguished with distinct background colors for improved readability.
  * **Color-coded Edges**: Dependency types (`owns`, `uses`) are represented with different edge colors, making relationships clearer.
  * **Simplified Visuals**: Unnecessary edges are filtered out to reduce clutter and highlight meaningful connections, ensuring the generated diagrams are clean and easy to understand.
* **Extensible Design**: The project is built with extensibility in mind, allowing for future additions of new analysis types, visualization options, and integration with other dependency generation tools.

## Project Idea and Workflow

The core idea is to provide a robust command-line interface (`manage.py`) that takes a raw DOT dependency graph (e.g., from `cargo modules`) and transforms it into an insightful architectural overview.

Here's the typical workflow:

1. **Input**: Provide a DOT file representing your project's module dependencies (e.g., `graph.dot`).
2. **Parsing**: The tool parses this DOT file into an internal graph representation.
3. **Analysis**:
    * It checks for **circular dependencies** within your modules.
    * It identifies **violations of architectural layer rules**, ensuring your `domain`, `application`, and `infrastructure` layers adhere to their intended dependency flow.
4. **Transformation & Visualization**:
    * A new DOT file is generated. In this new file, modules are visually grouped into distinct layers using colored subgraphs.
    * Edges are color-coded based on their type (`owns` or `uses`) and filtered to show only the most relevant connections, reducing visual noise.
5. **Output**: The generated DOT file (e.g., `layered_graph.dot`) can then be rendered into an image (e.g., PNG, SVG) using Graphviz tools (e.g., `dot -Tpng layered_graph.dot -o output.png`). The tool also provides a summary of detected circular dependencies and layer violations.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

* Python 3.10+ (compatible with 3.11)
* Graphviz (for rendering DOT files into images)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/dot-layered-transform.git
    cd dot-layered-transform
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

Run the `manage.py` script from the command line:

```bash
python manage.py <INPUT_DOT_FILE> [-o <OUTPUT_DOT_FILE>]
```

* `<INPUT_DOT_FILE>`: Path to your original DOT file (e.g., `example/graph.dot`).
* `-o <OUTPUT_DOT_FILE>` (optional): Path where the transformed, layered DOT file will be saved. If omitted, the output will be printed to standard output.

**Example:**

```bash
# Analyze and generate a layered DOT file from an example graph
python manage.py example/graph.dot -o output_layered.dot

# Render the generated DOT file to a PNG image using Graphviz
dot -Tpng output_layered.dot -o output_layered.png
```

## Development and Contribution

This project is designed to be extensible. Future enhancements may include:

* Support for more complex layer definitions and custom rules.
* Integration with other dependency analysis tools.
* Interactive visualization features.
* More detailed reporting options.
